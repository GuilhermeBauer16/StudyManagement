# Study Management

## Objective  
The application allows user to create their study material with a title and description. The user can personalize 
the study material by adding some links to reference the topic he is studying. 
The user also can relate that study material with a specific course, being easy to find in the future.
But before accessing the app, sign up or log in.

## Learnings 
In that project, I put into practice the topics I recently learned. The first was to create a login system using Spring Security and JWT(JSON Web Token ) 
tokens to structure a login system with more security with the implementation of CRSF(Cross-site request forgery) and CORS(Cross-origin resource sharing). 
I implemented pipelines using GitHub actions in the project to deploy in Docker Hub when the main branch receives a pull request. Another pipeline 
I implemented only permitted pull requests to the main branch when sent by the develop branch. Implement the Sonar Cloud to control the code quality.

## Functionalities

* **Login** with Spring Security authentication.
* ```dotlogin
